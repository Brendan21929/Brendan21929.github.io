          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p1>I am a 10th-grade student. I enjoy looking at scenery, which is one of my hobbies. Personally, I'm not very skilled in photography, but I love using photos to capture the beautiful views that I find appealing. I believe that this hobby of mine is closely related to my love for reading because I often experience a whole new world through the words in books. The real-life scenery and beautiful things always stimulate my imagination and creativity.</p1>

          <h3>Personal goal</h3>
          <p1>If possible, I would like to develop aerial photography using drones as a future hobby. This way, the photos I capture would no longer be limited by height, and the perspectives of the images would be more diverse. China has many famous geological and scenic environments, so I would like to learn photography in the future and document these beautiful landscapes during my travels.</p1>
