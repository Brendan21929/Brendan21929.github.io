This is my personal website where I show one of my personal interest. I have selected and uploaded the photos I have taken before to the homepage. I have created two grids on the homepage, where I can place my text, images, or videos side by side. I have adjusted the font size and color to suit each type of text. I have also set one of the images as the connects to another page, which leads to my image set. In this page, I have also used a grid layout to showcase many of the photos I have taken.
